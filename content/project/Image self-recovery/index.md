This study aims to locate and recover tampered areas in images that have embedded watermarks. The embedded watermark is a type of fragile watermark that is highly sensitive to tampering, designed to detect and mark every potential change in the image. Therefore, this watermark is well-suited for validating the integrity of the image, and tampered areas can be accurately located through the embedded watermark information. After determining the location of tampered areas, the image can be precisely recovered using the watermark information. One significant challenge in the current research is how to minimize the impact of the embedded watermark on the image itself. Additionally, in cases where the embedding space in the image is limited, the focus of the current research is on utilizing less information to achieve high-quality image recovery.
