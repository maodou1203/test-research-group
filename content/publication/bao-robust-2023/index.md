abstract: This paper presents a novel image matching method for camera pose estimation
  based on point cloud segmentation. The Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief (ORB) is
  employed to extract the key points, which are then extracted based on matched point
  cloud planes. The point cloud planes are segmented based on the depth image, and
  then matched by the distance of the centroid between planes. The putative corresponding
  key points on the planes are generated based on the distance of their 3-D coordinates
  and the descriptors of the key points are further matched based on the putative
  corresponding key points. As an additional constraint, the spatial relative position
  in 3-D spaces solves the problem that the descriptors of each key point in some
  scenarios are too similar which may lead to a mismatch. According to the experimental
  results, the superiority of the proposed approach is illustrated by comparing with
  the existing matching methods.
