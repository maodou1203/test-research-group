abstract: 'In this paper, a Multi-Level Dense Descriptor (MLDD) extraction method
  and a Hierarchical Feature Matching method are proposed to detect copy–move forgery
  in digital images. The MLDD extraction method extracts the dense feature descriptors
  using multiple levels, while the extracted dense descriptor consists of two parts:
  the Color Texture Descriptor and the Invariant Moment Descriptor. After calculating
  the MLDD for each pixel, the Hierarchical Feature Matching method subsequently detects
  forgery regions in the input image. First, the pixels that have similar color textures
  are grouped together into distinctive neighbor pixel sets. Next, each pixel is matched
  with pixels in its corresponding neighbor pixel set through its geometric invariant
  moments. Then, the redundant pixels from previously generated matched pixel pairs
  are filtered out by the proposed Adaptive Distance and Orientation Based Filtering
  method. Finally, some morphological operations are applied to generate the final
  detected forgery regions. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can
  achieve much better detection results compared with the existing state-of-the-art
  CMFD methods, even under various challenging conditions such as geometric transforms,
  JPEG compression, noise addition and down-sampling.'
