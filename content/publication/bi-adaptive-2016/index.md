abstract: In this paper, an Adaptive Polar based Filtering Method is proposed for
  image copy-move forgery detection. In order to improve the performance of detection
  method, the post-processing of the matching results is worth being focused on. To
  filter out the redundant pixels from the initially matched pixels, two pixels sets-Symmetrical
  Matched Pixels set and Unsymmetrical Matched Pixels set, are extracted from the
  matched pixel pairs, furthermore, the polar distributions of the two sets are calculated
  respectively. Then, the filtering thresholds can be adaptively calculated according
  to the polar distribution, thus the redundant pixels can be filtered out accordingly.
  Finally, some morphological operations are applied to the remained pixels to generate
  the detected forged regions. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme
  can achieve much better detection results compared with the existing state-of-the-art
  copy-move forgery detection methods.
