abstract: Background and objective Wheezing is a common symptom of patients caused
  by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Wheezing detection identifies
  wheezing lung sounds and helps physicians in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment
  of pulmonary diseases. Different from the traditional way to detect wheezing sounds
  using digital image process methods, automatic wheezing detection uses computerized
  tools or algorithms to objectively and accurately assess and evaluate lung sounds.
  We propose an innovative machine learning-based approach for wheezing detection.
  The phases of the respiratory sounds are separated automatically and the wheezing
  features are extracted accordingly to improve the classification accuracy. Methods
  To enhance the features of wheezing for classification, the Adaptive Multi-Level
  In-Exhale Segmentation (AMIE$_textrmS$EG) is proposed to automatically and precisely
  segment the respiratory sounds into inspiratory and expiratory phases. Furthermore,
  the Enhanced Generalized S-Transform (EGST) is proposed to extract the wheezing
  features. The highlighted features of wheezing improve the accuracy of wheezing
  detection with machine learning-based classifiers. Results To evaluate the novelty
  and superiority of the proposed AMIE$_textrmS$EG and EGST for wheezing detection,
  we employ three machine learning-based classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM),
  Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), with public datasets
  at segment level and record level respectively. According to the experimental results,
  the proposed method performs the best using the KNN classifier at segment level,
  with the measured accuracy, sensitivity, specificity as 98.62%, 95.9% and 99.3%
  in average respectively. On the other aspect, at record level, the three classifiers
  perform excellent, with the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity up to 99.52%, 100%
  and 99.27% respectively. We validate the method with public respiratory sounds dataset.
  Conclusion The comparison results indicate the very good performance of the proposed
  methods for long-term wheezing monitoring and telemedicine.
