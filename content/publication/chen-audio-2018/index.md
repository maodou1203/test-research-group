abstract: Audio tampering is typically followed by post-processing operations to mask
  the artifacts potentially perceptible by human ears and blur the traces of tampering.
  However, research on the issue of audio post-processing identification is still
  a blanket. This paper mainly introduces a method to identify audio post-processing
  operations. A new audio feature - Audio Amplitude-Level Quantification Vector (AQV)
  is proposed, then the probability distributions of AQV of audio are calculated and
  extracted as audio features which are then used for identification of various audio
  processing. During the detection, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is applied
  for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed AQV method can not
  only verify the authenticity of the speech audio, but also have a significant effect
  on identifying different types of post-processing operations.
