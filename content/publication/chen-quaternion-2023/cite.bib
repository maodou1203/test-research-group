 abstract = {Recently, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have had a large impact on imaging process including medical image segmentation, and the real-valued convolution of DNN has been extensively utilized in multi-modal medical image segmentation to accurately segment lesions via learning data information. However, the weighted summation operation in such convolution limits the ability to maintain spatial dependence that is crucial for identifying different lesion distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel Quaternion Cross-modality Spatial Learning (Q-CSL) which explores the spatial information while considering the linkage between multi-modal images. Specifically, we introduce to quaternion to represent data and coordinates that contain spatial information. Additionally, we propose Quaternion Spatial-association Convolution to learn the spatial information. Subsequently, the proposed De-level Quaternion Cross-modality Fusion (De-QCF) module excavates inner space features and fuses cross-modality spatial dependency. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach compared to the competitive methods perform well with only 0.01061M parameters and 9.95G FLOPs.
