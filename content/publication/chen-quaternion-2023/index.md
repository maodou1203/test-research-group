abstract: Recently, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have had a large impact on imaging
  process including medical image segmentation, and the real-valued convolution of
  DNN has been extensively utilized in multi-modal medical image segmentation to accurately
  segment lesions via learning data information. However, the weighted summation operation
  in such convolution limits the ability to maintain spatial dependence that is crucial
  for identifying different lesion distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
  Quaternion Cross-modality Spatial Learning (Q-CSL) which explores the spatial information
  while considering the linkage between multi-modal images. Specifically, we introduce
  to quaternion to represent data and coordinates that contain spatial information.
  Additionally, we propose Quaternion Spatial-association Convolution to learn the
  spatial information. Subsequently, the proposed De-level Quaternion Cross-modality
  Fusion (De-QCF) module excavates inner space features and fuses cross-modality spatial
  dependency. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach compared to the
  competitive methods perform well with only 0.01061M parameters and 9.95G FLOPs.
