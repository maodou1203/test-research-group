abstract: Digital respiratory sounds provide valuable information for telemedicine
  and smart diagnosis in an non-invasive way of pathological detection. As the typical
  continuous abnormal respiratory sound, wheeze is clinically correlated with asthma
  or chronic obstructive lung diseases. Meanwhile, the discontinuous adventitious
  crackle is clinically correlated with pneumonia, bronchitis, and so on. The detection
  and classification of both attract many studies for decades. However, due to the
  contained artifacts and constrained feature extraction methods, the reliability
  and accuracy of the classification of wheeze, crackle, and normal sounds need significant
  improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the identification of
  wheeze, crackle, and normal sounds using the optimized S-transform (OST) and deep
  residual networks (ResNets). First, the raw respiratory sound is processed by the
  proposed OST. Then, the spectrogram of OST is rescaled for the Resnet. After the
  feature learning and classification are fulfilled by the ResNet, the classes of
  respiratory sounds are recognized. Because the proposed OST highlights the features
  of wheeze, crackle, and respiratory sounds, and the deep residual learning generates
  discriminative features for better recognition, this proposed method provides reliable
  access for respiratory disease-related telemedicine and E-health diagnosis. The
  experimental results show that the proposed OST and ResNet is excellent for the
  multi-classification of respiratory sounds with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
  up to 98.79%, 96.27% and 100%, respectively. The comparison results of the triple-classification
  of respiratory sounds indicate that the proposed method outperforms the deep-learning-based
  ensembling convolutional neural network (CNN) by 3.23% and the empirical mode decomposition-based
  artificial neural network (ANN) by 4.63%, respectively.
