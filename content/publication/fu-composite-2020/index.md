abstract: This paper proposes an approach for speech emotion recognition based on
  the composite feature extraction. The traditional paralinguistic and prosodic features
  and the neurogram features are extracted and concatenated together to be the composite
  feature. The neural feature is presented by a computational model which outputs
  a series of responses of a speech's particular characteristic frequency through
  auditory nerve fiber. The exported responses signals are visualized as the 2D neurogram
  and then extracted as neural feature. With the extracted composite feature, support
  vector machines is used to classify the emotion. The eNTERFACE database is used
  and the various metrics are calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed
  approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves good performances
  under different conditions and performs better than the related work in terms of
  the various evaluation metrics.
