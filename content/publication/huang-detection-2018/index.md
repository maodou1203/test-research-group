abstract: As one of the main medium for information transmission, the digital imagecan
  be easily tampered during transmission. It is becoming more and more important to
  identifywhether the given image is an original image or a processed image. In this
  paper, we propose acompact universal feature based on spatial domain in virtue of
  some latest image forensic methods and design a multi-class classification scheme
  using the deep learning technique, to identify and furthermore classify the various
  normal image operations. According to the experimental results, the proposed method
  can well detect and classify the multiple common image post-processing operations.
  And the comparison with the existing feature shows the better performance of the
  proposed method.
