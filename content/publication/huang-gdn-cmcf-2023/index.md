abstract: Multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) is a crucial task in social systems
  of artificial intelligence that requires precise identification of named entities
  in sentences using both visual and textual information. Previous methods have focused
  on capturing fine-grained visual features and developing complex fusion procedures.
  However, these approaches overlook the heterogeneity gap and loss of original modality
  uniqueness that may occur during fusion, leading to incorrect entity identification.
  This article proposes a novel approach for MNER called a gated disentangled network
  with cross-modality consensus fusion (GDN-CMCF) to address the above challenges.
  Specifically, to eliminate cross-modality variation, we propose a cross-modality
  consensus fusion module that generates a consensus representation by learning inter-and
  intramodality interactions with a designed commonality constraint. We then introduce
  a gated disentanglement module to separate modality-relevant features from support
  and auxiliary modalities, which further filters out extraneous information while
  retaining the uniqueness of unimodal features. Experimental results on two real
  public datasets are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed GDN-CMCF.
