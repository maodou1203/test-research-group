abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have developed rapidly in data privacy protection
  applications such as medical treatment and finance. However, DNNs require high-speed
  and high-memory computers in terms of computation, otherwise training can be very
  lengthy. Furthermore, DNNs are often not available in resource-constrained mobile
  devices. Therefore, training and executing DNNs are increasingly using cloud computing.
  In the paper, the Power Normalized Cepstrum-based Robust Feature Detector (PNC-RFD),
  with deep learning in the cloud computing, is proposed for data privacy protection.
  The proposed PNC-RFD extracts a specified number of signal segments of high robustness
  used to embed and extract various data. For the sake of embedding and extracting
  the data, a method of information hiding employing Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Packet
  Transform (DT CWPT) is therefore presented. The presented scheme simultaneously
  embeds multiple data into coefficients of the DT CWPT of signal segments. By embedding
  the data into the orthogonal spaces, the proposed method ensures the independent
  extraction of the multiple data. In line with the performance analysis, the superiority
  of the presented scheme is elaborated through making the comparison with the current
  state-of-the-art methods.
