abstract: "Deep neural networks (DNNs) could be affected by the regression level of learning frameworks and challenging changes caused by external factors; their deep expressiveness is greatly restricted. Inspired by the fine-tuned DNNs with sensitivity disparity to the pixels of two states, in this paper, we propose a novel change detection scheme served by sensitivity disparity networks (CD-SDN). The CD-SDN is proposed for detecting changes in bi-temporal hyper-spectral images captured by the AVIRIS sensor and HYPERION sensor over time. In the CD-SDN, two deep learning frameworks, unchanged sensitivity network (USNet) and changed sensitivity network (CSNet), are utilized as the dominant part for the generation of binary argument map (BAM) and high assurance map (HAM). Then two approaches, arithmetic mean and argument learning, are employed to re-estimate the changes of BAM. Finally, the detected results are merged with HAM and obtain the final detected binary change maps (BCMs). Experiments are performed on three real-world hyperspectral image datasets, and the results indicate the good universality and adaptability of the proposed scheme, as well as its superiority over other existing state-of-the-art algorithms."
