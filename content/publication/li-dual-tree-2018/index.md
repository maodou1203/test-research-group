abstract: This paper presents a local audio watermarking method based on the dual-tree
  complex wavelet transform (DT CWT) and distortion-compensated dither modulation
  (DC-DM). Specifically, we perform DT CWT on extracted audio segment, and embed the
  watermark signal in the decomposed low-pass coefficients. During the embedding process,
  the selected coefficients are block-divided into multiple host vectors, and the
  watermark signal is embedded into the selected set of host vectors by the dither
  modulation process. During the extraction process, the DC-DM is applied to generate
  the statistical differences, and the minimum distance decoding is employed to extract
  the watermark signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust
  against common signal processing attacks and de-synchronization attacks, such as
  re-quantization, resampling, MP3 compression, cropping, and so on. Comparisons with
  the existing methods also show the superiority of our proposed method.
