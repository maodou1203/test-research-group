abstract: As a pragmatic and novel application of digital watermarking, image quality
  estimation has been studied in recent years. In this paper, we propose a watermarking-based
  image quality evaluation scheme. The Logarithmic Spread Transform Dither Modulation
  is proposed based on the quantization index modulation and then applied to embed
  and extract the watermarks. The traditional objective metrics are employed to measure
  quality of images. We calculate the True Detection Rates (TDR) value to represent
  degradation of watermark. Considering that the embedded watermark and the watermarked
  image are distorted simultaneously, the image quality can be evaluated by matching
  the TDR value with a quality value on a pre-generated curve. Experimental results
  indicate that the proposed scheme provides a good image quality estimation result.
  The accuracy of the estimation keeps stabilization under different tested attacks,
  including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise addition and low-pass filtering.
