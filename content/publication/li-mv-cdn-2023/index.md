abstract: Since individual neural networks have limited deep expressiveness and effectiveness,
  many learning frameworks face difficulties in the availability and balance of sample
  selection. As a result, in change detection, it is difficult to upgrade the hit
  rate of a high-performance model on both positive and negative pixels. Therefore,
  supposing that the sacrificed components coincide perfectly with the important evaluation
  objectives, such as positives, it would lose more than gain. To address this issue,
  in this paper, we propose a multi-visual collaborative deep network (MV-CDN) served
  by three collaborative network members that consists of three subdivision approaches,
  the CDN with one collaborator (CDN-C), CDN with two collaborators (CDN-2C), and
  CDN with three collaborators (CDN-3C). The purpose of the collaborator is to re-evaluate
  the feature elements in the network transmission, and thus to translate the group-thinking
  into a more robust field of vision. We use three sets of public double-temporal
  hyperspectral images taken by the AVIRIS and HYPERION sensors to show the feasibility
  of the proposed schema. The comparison results have confirmed that our proposed
  schema outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms on the three tested
  datasets, which demonstrates the broad adaptability and progressiveness of the proposal.
