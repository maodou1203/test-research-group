abstract: In this paper, a new Quaternion Discrete Fourier Transform (QDFT)-based
  digital color image watermarking method is presented. In addition, the Quaternion
  QR (QQR) decomposition is applied in digital watermarking technology for the first
  time. First of all, the QDFT and QQR decomposition are performed on the host image,
  respectively, to acquire the scalar part of the quaternion matrix for watermark
  information embedding. After that, we divide the scalar part of the quaternion matrix
  generated by the QQR decomposition into blocks and calculate the entropy. The block
  with high entropy is selected to embed the watermark information. Then the watermark
  information is embedded into the extracted block using the quantization index modulation
  method. We conducted a large number of tests and experimental results indicate that
  the presented approach obtains excellent robustness against Scaling, Rotation, Median
  filtering, `Salt & Pepper' noise, and JPEG Compression. Compared with the existing
  methods, the presented method achieves better performance.
