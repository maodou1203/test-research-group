abstract: This paper proposes a local digital image watermarking method based on robust
  feature extraction. A robust feature extraction method is proposed based on DAISY
  to extract feature regions. Each feature region is decomposed into approximation
  and details sub-bands by wavelet transform and the watermark is then embedded into
  and/or extracted from the approximation coefficients. Spread Transform Dither Modulation
  is applied to embed and extract the watermark. Multiple copies of watermark images
  are embedded into the feature regions to increase the success rate of watermark
  extraction and meanwhile improve the robustness. Experimental results show the very
  good image quality of the watermarked image and the low Bit Error Rate of watermark
  extraction. Furthermore, the comparison results indicate the better performance
  and higher robustness of the proposed scheme when under various attacks comparing
  with the existing methods.
