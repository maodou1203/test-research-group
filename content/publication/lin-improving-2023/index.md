abstract: Objective. Due to the blurry edges and uneven shape of breast tumors, breast
  tumor segmentation can be a challenging task. Recently, deep convolution networks
  based approaches achieve satisfying segmentation results. However, the learned shape
  information of breast tumors might be lost owing to the successive convolution and
  down-sampling operations, resulting in limited performance. Approach. To this end,
  we propose a novel shape-guided segmentation (SGS) framework that guides the segmentation
  networks to be shape-sensitive to breast tumors by prior shape information. Different
  from usual segmentation networks, we guide the networks to model shape-shared representation
  with the assumption that shape information of breast tumors can be shared among
  samples. Specifically, on the one hand, we propose a shape guiding block (SGB) to
  provide shape guidance through a superpixel pooling-unpooling operation and attention
  mechanism. On the other hand, we further introduce a shared classification layer
  (SCL) to avoid feature inconsistency and additional computational costs. As a result,
  the proposed SGB and SCL can be effortlessly incorporated into mainstream segmentation
  networks (e.g. UNet) to compose the SGS, facilitating compact shape-friendly representation
  learning. Main results. Experiments conducted on a private dataset and a public
  dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the SGS compared to other advanced methods.
  Significance. We propose a united framework to encourage existing segmentation networks
  to improve breast tumor segmentation by prior shape information. The source code
  will be made available at https://github.com/TxLin7/Shape-Seg.
