abstract: Objective. In the field of endoscopic imaging, Super-Resolution (SR) plays
  an important role in Manufactured Diagnosis, physicians and machine Automatic Diagnosis.
  Although many recent studies have been performed, by using deep convolutional neural
  networks on endoscopic Super-Resolution, most of the methods have large parameters,
  which limits their practical application. In addition, almost all of these methods
  treat each channel equally based on the real-valued domain, without considering
  the difference among the different channels. Our objective is to design a super-resolution
  model named Quaternion Attention Multi-scale Widening Network (QAMWN) for endoscopy
  images to address the above problem. Approach. QAMWN contains a stacked Quaternion
  Attention Multi-Scale Widening Block (QAMWB), that composed of Multi-Scale Feature
  Widening Aggregation Module (MFWAM) and Quaternion Residual Channel Attention (QRCA).
  The MFWAM adopts multi-scale architecture with step-wise widening on feature channels
  for better feature extraction; and in QRCA, quaternion is introduced to construct
  Residual Channel Attention Mechanism, which obtains adaptively scales features by
  considering compact cross channel interactions in the hyper-complex domain. Main
  results. To verify the efficacy of our method, it is performed on two public endoscopic
  datasets, CVC ClinicDB and Kvasir dataset. The experimental results show that our
  proposed method can achieve a better trade-off in model size and performance. More
  importantly, the proposed QAMWN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in
  both metrics and visualization. Significance. We propose a lightweight super-resolution
  network for endoscopy and achieves better performance with fewer parameters, which
  helps in clinical diagnosis of endoscopy.
