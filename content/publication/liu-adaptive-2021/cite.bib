 abstract = {This article proposes an adaptive scheme for image tampered region localization and content recovery. To generate the watermark information comprised of the authentication data and recovery data, we firstly propose the Adaptive Authentication Feature Calculation algorithm to obtain the authentication data, which includes the information of block location and block feature. The DWT-based Block Feature Calculation method is then proposed to calculate the block feature, and the quantization method is employed to calculate the block location. The recovery data is composed of self-recovery bits and mapped-recovery bits. The self-recovery bits are obtained by the Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees encoding algorithm. For retrieving the damaged codes caused by tampering, we propose the Diagonal Mapping algorithm and apply it to the self-recovery bits, thus generating the mapped-recovery bits, to provide a guarantee of recovery data. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of tamper detection and image recovery, by comparing with the state-of-the-art works. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows efficiency in the adaptiveness, well localization, strong capability for image recovery, and the effectiveness of attack resistance.},
