abstract: This article proposes an adaptive scheme for image tampered region localization
  and content recovery. To generate the watermark information comprised of the authentication
  data and recovery data, we firstly propose the Adaptive Authentication Feature Calculation
  algorithm to obtain the authentication data, which includes the information of block
  location and block feature. The DWT-based Block Feature Calculation method is then
  proposed to calculate the block feature, and the quantization method is employed
  to calculate the block location. The recovery data is composed of self-recovery
  bits and mapped-recovery bits. The self-recovery bits are obtained by the Set Partitioning
  in Hierarchical Trees encoding algorithm. For retrieving the damaged codes caused
  by tampering, we propose the Diagonal Mapping algorithm and apply it to the self-recovery
  bits, thus generating the mapped-recovery bits, to provide a guarantee of recovery
  data. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed scheme
  in terms of tamper detection and image recovery, by comparing with the state-of-the-art
  works. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows efficiency in the
  adaptiveness, well localization, strong capability for image recovery, and the effectiveness
  of attack resistance.
