abstract: This paper proposes a novel image self-recovery scheme based on authentication
  feature extraction. The Authentication Feature Extraction method is proposed to
  calculate the authentication information. The Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees
  encoding algorithm is employed to calculate the recovery information. Moreover,
  in order to retrieve the damaged information caused by tampering, we propose to
  map each block into another position and generate the mapped-recovery information
  accordingly. In this way, a double assurance of recovery information can be provided.
  Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms
  of image self-recovery. Comparison with the state-of-the-art works demonstrate that
  the proposed scheme shows efficiency in strong capability for image recovery, and
  effectiveness of attack resistance.
