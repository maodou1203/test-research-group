abstract: Abstract Emotion plays a dominant role in speech. The same utterance with
  different emotions can lead to a completely different meaning. The ability to perform
  various of emotion during speaking is also one of the typical characters of human.
  In this case, technology trends to develop advanced speech emotion classification
  algorithms in the demand of enhancing the interaction between computer and human
  beings. This paper proposes a speech emotion classification approach based on the
  paralinguistic and spectral features extraction. The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
  (MFCC) are extracted as spectral feature, and openSMILE is employed to extract the
  paralinguistic feature. The machine learning techniques multi-layer perceptron classifier
  and support vector machines are respectively applied into the extracted features
  for the classification of the speech emotions. We have conducted experiments on
  the Berlin database to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental
  results show that the proposed approach achieves satisfied performances. Comparisons
  are conducted in clean condition and noisy condition respectively, and the results
  indicate better performance of the proposed scheme.
