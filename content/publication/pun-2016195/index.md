abstract: Noise discrepancies in multiple scales are utilized as indicators for image
  splicing forgery detection in this paper. Specifically, the test image is initially
  segmented into superpixels of multiple scales. In each individual scale, noise level
  function, which reflects the relation between noise level and brightness of each
  segment, is computed. Those segments not constrained by the noise level function
  are regarded as suspicious regions. In the final step, pixels appears in suspicious
  regions of each scale, after necessary morphological processing, are marked as spliced
  region(s). The Optimal Parameter Combination Searching (OPCS) Algorithm is proposed
  to determine the optimal parameters during the process. Two datasets are created
  for training the optimal parameters and to evaluate the proposed scheme, respectively.
  The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective, especially
  for the multi-objects splicing. In addition, the proposed scheme is proven to be
  superior to the existing state-of-the-art method.
