abstract: A robust and geometric invariant digital image watermarking scheme based
  on SIFT Based Feature Points Detector (SIFTFPD) and histogram distribution is proposed
  in this paper. The SIFTFPD is proposed to extract geometric invariant feature points
  from the host image for watermark embedding; and the descriptor is generated subsequently.
  With the feature extraction procedure, the circular regions centered at the extracted
  feature points and with the given radius are defined as embedding regions. For watermark
  embedding, some pixels are moved to form a specific pattern in the intensity-level
  histogram distribution in each embedding region, to indicate the watermark. For
  watermark extraction, the embedded regions are generated with the descriptor and
  according to the intensity-level histogram distribution in each region, the watermark
  can be extracted. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is very robust
  against geometric distortion such as rotation, scaling, cropping, and affine transformation;
  and common signal processing, such as JPEG compression, median filtering, and Gaussian
  low-pass filtering.
