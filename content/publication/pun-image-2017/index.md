abstract: Tampering detection methods based on image hashing have been widely studied
  with continuous advancements. However, most existing models cannot generate object-level
  tampering localization results, because the forensic hashes attached to the image
  lack contour information. In this paper, we present a novel tampering detection
  model that can generate an accurate, object-level tampering localization result.
  First, an adaptive image segmentation method is proposed to segment the image into
  closed regions based on strong edges. Then, the color and position features of the
  closed regions are extracted as a forensic hash. Furthermore, a geometric invariant
  tampering localization model named image alignment-based multi-region matching (IAMRM)
  is proposed to establish the region correspondence between the received and forensic
  images by exploiting their intrinsic structure information. The model estimates
  the parameters of geometric transformations via a robust image alignment method
  based on triangle similarity; in addition, it matches multiple regions simultaneously
  by utilizing manifold ranking based on different graph structures and features.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IAMRM is a promising method for
  object-level tampering detection compared with the state-ofthe-art methods.
