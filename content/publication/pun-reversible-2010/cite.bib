 abstract = {A novel reversible watermarking scheme based on 2-D Lifting wavelet transform, LWT2, integer transform and block linking method is presented in the paper. LWT2 produces coefficient subbands whose values are in integer form. The integer transform is then applied for embedding watermark bits. In addition, the simple and fast block linking method is used for indicating the embedding location. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve high capacity for image watermarking while preserve good image quality.},
