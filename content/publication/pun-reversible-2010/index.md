abstract: A novel reversible watermarking scheme based on 2-D Lifting wavelet transform,
  LWT2, integer transform and block linking method is presented in the paper. LWT2
  produces coefficient subbands whose values are in integer form. The integer transform
  is then applied for embedding watermark bits. In addition, the simple and fast block
  linking method is used for indicating the embedding location. Experimental results
  show that our proposed method can achieve high capacity for image watermarking while
  preserve good image quality.
