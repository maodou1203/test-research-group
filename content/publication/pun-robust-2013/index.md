abstract: A robust feature points detector for invariant audio watermarking is proposed
  in this paper. The audio segments centering at the detected feature points are extracted
  for both watermark embedding and extraction. These feature points are invariant
  to various attacks and will not be changed much for maintaining high auditory quality.
  Besides, high robustness and inaudibility can be achieved by embedding the watermark
  into the approximation coefficients of Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) domain,
  which is shift invariant. The spread spectrum communication technique is adopted
  to embed the watermark. Experimental results show that the proposed Robust Audio
  Segments Extractor (RASE) and the watermarking scheme are not only robust against
  common audio signal processing, such as low-pass filtering, MP3 compression, echo
  addition, volume change, and normalization; and distortions introduced in Stir-mark
  benchmark for Audio; but also robust against synchronization geometric distortions
  simultaneously, such as resample time-scale modification (TSM) with scaling factors
  up to ±50%, pitch invariant TSM by ±50%, and tempo invariant pitch shifting by ±50%.
  In general, the proposed scheme can well resist various attacks by the joint RASE
  and SWT approach, which performs much better comparing with the existing state-of-the
  art methods.
