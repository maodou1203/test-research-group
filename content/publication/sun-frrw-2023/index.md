abstract: This paper introduces a feature extraction-based approach to ensure both
  robustness and reversibility of image. Low-order Zernike moments are utilized to
  embed a robust binary image as a watermark, which is used for information authentication.
  A reversible watermark is embedded outside the robust watermark regions and is employed
  for the purpose of restoring the cover image. It uses the combination of histogram
  shifting and prediction error, which can improve image restoration quality. Steady
  feature points are extracted in two ways, the speed-up robust features (SURF) algorithm
  and the oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB) algorithm. After extracting the feature
  points, the regions are obtained by extending the Ô¨Ånal selected feature points to
  embed the watermark. Consequently, the presented watermarking technique combines
  robust and reversible watermarking which has the ability to enhance the invisibility
  of the watermark and the clarity of image restoration. It is possible to extract
  the watermark even after an attack has been made on the watermarked image. Or we
  can recover the original image with no attacks. The results from the experiments
  indicate that the suggested method is resilient to geometric deformations, involving
  scaling and rotation, along with typical signal manipulation attacks, including
  noisebased attacks.
