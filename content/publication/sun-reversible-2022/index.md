abstract: As a special way of hiding information, reversible data hiding is mostly
  used to embed data into digital multimedia. The original multimedia and embedded
  data can be restored from the watermarked one without any loss. Being different
  from the traditional reversible data hiding methods, the gray scale-invariant reversible
  watermarking method, which keeps the grayscale of image unchanged as the information
  is embedded, is proposed for color images recently. Although color images are widely
  used in practice, there are more reversible data hiding algorithms and feature points
  extraction algorithms for gray images rather than color images. In this paper, two
  multiple watermarking mechanisms have been proposed for color images with grayscale
  invariance, the multi-level watermarking mechanism, where one feature region is
  selected and the watermarks are embedded for multiple times, and the multi-region
  watermarking mechanism, where the multiple non-overlapping feature regions are selected
  to embed watermarks. Different from others, the former mechanism uses multiple embeddings
  based on the feature regions to increase the embedding capacity and the latter one
  uses local embedding instead of global embedding to reduce the impact on the whole
  image. At the same time, the selection of feature points can meet certain conditions
  and get more suitable regions for information embedding. Experimental results show
  that the proposed scheme can extend the capacity efficiently while keep the characteristic
  of grayscale invariance.
