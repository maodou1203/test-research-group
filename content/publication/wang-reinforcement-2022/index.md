abstract: Task scheduling on edge computing servers is a critical concern affecting
  user experience. Current scheduling methods attain an overall appealing performance
  through centralized control. Nevertheless, forcing users to act based on a centralized
  control is impractical. Hence, this work suggests a game theory-based distributed
  edge computing server task scheduling model. The proposed method comprehensively
  considers the mobile device-server link quality and the serverâ€™s computing resource
  allocation and balances link quality and computing resources requirements when selecting
  edge computing servers. Furthermore, we develop a time series prediction algorithm
  based on IndRNN and LSTM to accurately predict link quality. Once Nash equilibrium
  is reached quickly through our proposed acceleration scheme, the proposed model
  provides various QoS for different priority users. The experimental results highlight
  that the developed solution provides differentiated services while optimizing computing
  resource scheduling and ensuring an approximate Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.
