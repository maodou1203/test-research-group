abstract: The main problem addressed in this paper is the robust tampering detection
  of the image received in a transmission under various content-preserving attacks.
  To this aim the multi-scale image hashing method is proposed by using the location-context
  information of the features generated by adaptive and local feature extraction techniques.
  The generated hash is attached to the image before transmission and analyzed at
  destination to filter out the geometric transformations occurred in the received
  image by image restoration firstly. Based on the restored image, the image authentication
  using the global and color hash component is performed to determine whether the
  received image has the same contents as the trusted one or has been maliciously
  tampered, or just different. After regarding the received image as being tampered,
  the tampered regions will be localized through the multi-scale hash component. Lots
  of experiments are conducted to indicate that our tampering detection scheme outperforms
  the existing state-of-the-art methods and is very robust against the content-preserving
  attacks, including both common signal processing and geometric distortions.
