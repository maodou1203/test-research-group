abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-scale image hashing method by using the
  location-context information of the features generated by adaptive local feature
  extraction techniques. The adaptive local feature extraction method is proposed
  for more robust feature descriptors. The global hash is calculated to determine
  whether the received image has been maliciously tampered. The multi-scale hash is
  calculated to locate the tampered regions. Experimental results show that the proposed
  tampering detection scheme is very robust against the content-preserving attacks,
  including both common signal processing and geometric distortions.
