abstract: Image-hashing-based tampering detection methods have been widely studied
  with continuous advancements. However, most of existing models are designed for
  a specific tampering. In this paper, we propose a novel quaternion-based image hashing
  to detect almost all types of tampering, including color changing, copy move, splicing,
  and so on. First, the quaternion Fourier-Mellin transform is used to calculate the
  geometric hash to eliminate the influence of geometric distortions. Then, a new
  quaternion image construction method, which combines advantages of both color and
  structural features, is proposed to implement the quaternion Fourier transform to
  calculate the image feature hash to locate the tampered regions. The objective is
  to provide a reasonably short image hashing with good performance, i.e., being perceptually
  robust against various content-preserving attacks while capable of detecting and
  locating almost all types of tampering. Furthermore, an adaptive tampering localization
  algorithm is proposed based on clustering analysis to improve the detection accuracy.
  The experimental results show that the proposed tampering detection model outperforms
  the existing state-of-the-art models and is very robust against various content-preserving
  attacks.
