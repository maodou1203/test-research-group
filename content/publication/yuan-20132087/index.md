abstract: A novel digital image watermarking scheme based on feature extraction and
  local Zernike transform is proposed in this paper. We proposed a local Zernike moments
  based watermarking scheme where the watermarked image/region can be obtained directly
  by inverse Zernike Transform. An edge-based feature detector is proposed for local
  region extraction, with which, the distinct circular patch of given size can be
  extracted for watermark embedding and extraction. The extracted circular patch is
  decomposed into a collection of binary patches and Zernike transform is applied
  to the selected binary patches. Magnitudes of the local Zernike moments are calculated
  and modified to embed the watermarks. Experimental results show that the proposed
  watermarking scheme is very robust against geometric distortion such as rotation,
  scaling, cropping, and affine transformation; and common signal processing such
  as JPEG compression, median filtering, and low-pass Gaussian filtering.
