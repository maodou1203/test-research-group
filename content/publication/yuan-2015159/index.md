abstract: A novel digital audio watermarking scheme based on robust Mel-Frequency
  Cepstral coefficients feature detection and dual-tree complex wavelet transform
  is proposed in this paper, which is similar as patchwork based methods that several
  segments are extracted from the host audio clip for watermarking use. The robust
  Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients feature detection method is proposed to extract
  the feature segments which should be relocated when the host audio signal attacked
  by various distortions including both the common audio signal processing and the
  conventional geometric distortions. With the robust feature segments, the approximate
  shift invariant transform dual-tree complex wavelet transform based watermarking
  method is proposed to embed the watermark into the DT CWT real low-pass coefficients
  of each segment, using the spread spectrum techniques. The linear correlation is
  calculated to judge the existence of the watermark during the watermark detection.
  Experimental results show that the proposed digital audio watermarking scheme based
  on robust Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients feature detection and dual-tree complex
  wavelet transform can achieve high robustness against the common audio signal processing,
  such as low-pass filtering, MP3 compression, echo addition, volume change, and normalization;
  and geometric distortions, such as resample Time-Scale Modification (TSM), pitch
  invariant TSM, and tempo invariant pitch shifting. In addition, the proposed audio
  watermarking scheme is resilient to Stir-mark for Audio, and it performs much better
  comparing with the existing state-of-the art methods.
