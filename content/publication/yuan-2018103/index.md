abstract: This paper proposes a local multi-watermarking method based on robust and
  adaptive feature extraction. The Robust and Adaptive Feature Detector based on DAISY
  Descriptor (RAF3D) is proposed to extract the feature regions of high robustness
  and stability. The multi-watermarking method is proposed to embed the multiple watermarks
  simultaneously into the same extracted feature region. In this way, the capacity
  will be flexible with either the number of feature regions or the number of watermarks.
  In the proposed method, the Gram–Schmidt process is applied to embed the watermarks
  in orthogonal spaces, which guarantees the multiple watermarks can be extracted
  independently. By repeatedly embedding the watermarks into the numerous feature
  regions, the success rate of watermark detection can be greatly strengthened. In
  addition, the local embedding strategy improves the imperceptibility of the watermarked
  image. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
  scheme and the comparison with several existing methods demonstrate that the proposed
  scheme outperforms the existing methods in terms of the robustness against various
  attacks.
