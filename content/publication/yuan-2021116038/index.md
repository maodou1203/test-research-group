abstract: This paper proposes a novel Gauss–Jordan elimination-based image tampering
  detection and self-recovery scheme, aiming at dealing with the problem of malicious
  tampering on digital images. To deal with the copy–move tampering which is challenging
  because the tampered region may contain the watermark information, we propose the
  Improved Check Bits Generation algorithm during watermark generation, to generate
  the check bits for tampering detection. Meanwhile, the recovery bits are reconstructed
  according to the fundamental of Gauss–Jordan Elimination, for purpose of image contents
  self-recovery. To improve the accuracy of detection and the quality of recovered
  images, we propose the Morphological Processing-Based Enhancement method and the
  Edge Extension preprocessing respectively during and after the tampering detection
  Finally, the Gauss–JordanElimination-Based Self-Recovery method is proposed to recover
  the damaged content mathematically on basis of the detected results. By employing
  the unchanged recovery bits which are embedded in the non-tampered region, the failure
  in recovery caused by the damaged recovery bits can be completely avoided. A large
  number of experiments have been conducted to show the very good performance of the
  proposed scheme. The precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated for evaluation
  of tampering detection, while the PSNR values are calculated for evaluation of image
  recovery. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed
  scheme shows the superiorities in terms of imperceptibility, security and recovery
  capability. The experimental result indicates the average PSNR of recovered image
  is 44.415dB.
