abstract: This paper presents a Dual Partial Recurrent Networks (DUALPRNs) which can
  project more accurate and effective image features by learning invariant pixel pairs
  with high confidence. The Change Vector Analysis provides a reference for the model
  to select invariant pixel pairs with high confidence as training samples. Then,
  the Unsupervised Slow Feature Analysis (USFA) is utilized to suppress the invariant
  pixel features projected by DUAL-PRNs, and highlight the variant pixel features,
  respectively. Thus, more obvious discrimination between the invariant and variant
  pixels can be achieved. Two groups of features are then obtained by passing bi-temporal
  remote sensing images through DUAL-PRNs and USFA. Chi-square distance is employed
  to calculate the divergence between two groups of features and thus generate the
  Change Intensity Map. Finally, the thresholding algorithm transforms the change
  intensity map into binary change map. Experimental results show that the proposed
  change detection model DUAL-PRNs performs better than the advanced model DSFA-128-2.
