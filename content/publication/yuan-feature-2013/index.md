abstract: This paper proposes a digital video watermarking scheme which is robust
  to geometric distortions, such as rotation, scaling, and cropping. The watermark
  is embedded / extracted based on feature extraction and local Zernike transform
  in / from each selected frame. The feature extraction method called Adaptive Harris
  Detector is proposed by adopting and revising the traditional Harris Corner Detector,
  and the local Zernike moments-based method is raised for watermarking use. In each
  selected frame, the extracted circular patches are decomposed into a collection
  of binary patches with Bit-Plane Decomposition method. Magnitudes of the local Zernike
  moments are calculated by Zernike transform and modified to embed the watermarks.
  Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme is robust against
  geometric distortions and meanwhile preserves the imperceptibility of the video.
  Furthermore, it outperforms comparable methods when tested under common signal processing
  attacks.
