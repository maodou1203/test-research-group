abstract: A robust and geometric invariant digital image watermarking scheme based
  on robust feature points detector and local Zernike transform is proposed in this
  paper. The robust feature points detector is proposed based on SIFT algorithm to
  extract circular patches. A local Zernike moments-based watermarking scheme is raised.
  Each extracted circular patch is decomposed into a collection of binary patches
  and Zernike transform is applied to the appointed binary patches. Experimental results
  show that the proposed scheme is very robust against geometric distortions and common
  signal processing.
