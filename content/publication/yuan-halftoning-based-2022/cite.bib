 abstract = {This paper proposes a halftoning-based fragile watermarking approach for digital image tamper detection and self-recovery. The Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) algorithm and halftoning technique are employed to generate the primary recovery bits and secondary recovery bits, respectively. On basis of that, the authentication bits are generated. The Arnold Cat Map and diagonal mapping are then applied to further improve the accuracy of tamper detection and ensure the quality of self-recovery. The experimental results have been conducted to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed approach in imperceptibility and recovery capability.},
