abstract: This paper proposes a halftoning-based fragile watermarking approach for
  digital image tamper detection and self-recovery. The Set Partitioning in Hierarchical
  Trees (SPIHT) algorithm and halftoning technique are employed to generate the primary
  recovery bits and secondary recovery bits, respectively. On basis of that, the authentication
  bits are generated. The Arnold Cat Map and diagonal mapping are then applied to
  further improve the accuracy of tamper detection and ensure the quality of self-recovery.
  The experimental results have been conducted to demonstrate the superiorities of
  the proposed approach in imperceptibility and recovery capability.
