abstract: A robust and geometric invariant digital image watermarking scheme based
  on feature extraction and histogram distribution is proposed in this paper. The
  feature extraction method called Harris Corner Detector is adopted and revised by
  adjusting the response threshold value and ranking the response R value to extract
  feature points and thus define the regions for watermark data bits embedding and
  extraction. Each embedding region is a square matrix centering at the selected feature
  points. For watermark embedding, some pixels are moved to form a specific pattern
  in the intensity-level histogram distribution in each embedding region, indicating
  the watermark. For watermark extraction, the Adaptive Harris Corner Detector is
  adopted to restore the image to its original un-rotated position. According to the
  intensity-level histogram distribution in each embedded region, the watermark is
  extracted. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is very robust against
  rotation, scaling, JPEG compression, median filtering, low-pass Gaussian filtering
  and also noise pollution.
