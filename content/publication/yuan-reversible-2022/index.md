abstract: Reversible data hiding is to embed data into digital multimedia, while the
  original multimedia and embedded data can be restored from the watermarked one without
  any loss. In this paper, we propose a novel Reversible Multi-Level Watermarking
  (RMLW) scheme for color images with grayscale invariance. Being different from the
  traditional reversible data hiding methods, we adapt the gray scale-invariant reversible
  watermarking method which keeps the grayscale of image unchanged as the information
  is embedded. In the RMLW, one feature region of high robustness is extracted and
  into which the watermarks are then embedded for multiple times. Lots of experiments
  have been conducted and the results show that the proposed scheme can extend the
  capacity efficiently while keep the characteristic of grayscale invariance.
