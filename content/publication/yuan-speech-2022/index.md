abstract: 'This paper proposes a speech emotion recognition approach using the Multi-Layer
  Perceptron Classifier (MLP Classifier). The Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
  feature and openSMILE feature are respectively extracted. With the extracted features,
  MLP Classifier is used to classify the speech emotion. The Berlin database which
  contains seven emotions: happiness, anger, anxiety, fear, boredom and disgust, is
  used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Data augmentation are
  furtherly employed and experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves
  satisfied performances. Comparisons are conducted when with data augmentation and
  without data augmentation, and the results indicate better performance with data
  augmentation.'
