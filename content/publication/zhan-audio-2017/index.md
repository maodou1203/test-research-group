abstract: As an important communication medium, audios are easily modified or tampered
  during transmission; thus the authenticity of audios is of high importance. This
  paper mainly introduces a method to detect audio post-processing based on audio
  features; the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied for classification during
  the detection. In the proposed method, the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC)
  and the Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) of host audios are calculated as audio features,
  to which SVM is applied to judge the authenticity of the audios. Experimental results
  show that the proposed audio feature based method can not only verify the authenticity
  of speech audio, but also have a significant effect on detecting different types
  of post-processing operations.
