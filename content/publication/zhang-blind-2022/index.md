abstract: In this paper we propose a blind dual watermarking scheme using Set Partitioning
  in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) and Stucki Kernel halftone technique for the tamper
  detection and image self-recovery. The watermark consists of authentication bits
  for tampering area location and recovery bits for image restoration. We generate
  two recovery bits to ensure the high-quality recovery of the tampered image. The
  primary recovery bit is generated by the SPIHT encoding, and the secondary recovery
  bit is generated by the Stucki Kernel halftone technique. Then the authentication
  bit is generated based on the recovery bits. Before embedding the watermark, we
  shuffle the watermark bits through Arnold cat mapping and diagonal mapping to improve
  the security and quality of the restored image. LSB-based watermarking technique
  is used to embed the watermark into the original image to ensure the invisibility
  of the watermarked image. Experiments have been conducted on two datasets, BOW2
  and USC-SIPI, and results show that the proposed scheme can achieve high restoration
  quality. Comparison with the existing works demonstrate the good performance and
  superiority of the proposed scheme.
