abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Comprehensive-Monitoring-Motivated Multi-model
  Watermarking (C3MW) Scheme for tampering region localization and self-recovery for
  4K images. To generate the Comprehensive-Monitoring-Motivated Multi-model (C3M)
  Watermark, the MultiModel Authentication Bits Generation (MMAG) method and the Adaptive
  Block SignificanceBased Recovery Bits Generation (ASRG) method, are proposed. The
  MMAG aims to monitor the various bit-plane information for detecting the possible
  tampering in a more comprehensive manner. When performing image tampering detection,
  once one of the multiple models is triggered, the corresponding parcel will be marked
  as tampered. On basis of the detected regions, we propose a fine-tuning-based image
  recovery method, where the extracted recovery data consist of the fused Adaptive
  Block Significance (ABS) and bitmaps, while the calculated recovery data consist
  of the watermark information which is calculated from the received image. We conduct
  experiments on two public databases, respectively, the BOWS2 Dataset and the LIU4K-v2
  Dataset. Comparisons with existing state-of-the-art works have been performed on
  the BOWS2 dataset, and our scheme improves the precision and F1 Score by 7.27% and
  3.30%, respectively. It is clear from these results that our method has a better
  performance than others.
