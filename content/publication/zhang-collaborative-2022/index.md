abstract: Objective. In recent years, methods based on U-shaped structure and skip
  connection have achieved remarkable results in many medical semantic segmentation
  tasks. However, the information integration capability of this structure is still
  limited due to the incompatibility of feature maps of encoding and decoding stages
  at corresponding levels and lack of extraction of valid information in the ﬁnal
  stage of encoding. This structural defect is particularly obvious in segmentation
  tasks with non-obvious, small and blurred-edge targets. Our objective is to design
  a novel segmentation network to solve the above problems. Approach. The segmentation
  network named Global Context-Aware Network is mainly designed by inserting a Multi-feature
  Collaboration Adaptation (MCA) module, a Scale-Aware Mining (SAM) module and an
  Edge-enhanced Pixel Intensity Mapping (Edge-PIM) into the U-shaped structure. Firstly,
  the MCA module can integrate information from all encoding stages and then effectively
  acts on the decoding stages, solving the problem of information loss during downsampling
  and pooling. Secondly, the SAM module can further mine information from the encoded
  high-level features to enrich the information passed to the decoding stage. Thirdly,
  EdgePIM can further reﬁne the segmentation results by edge enhancement. Main results.
  We newly collect Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
  (MRI-CRLM) dataset in different imaging sequences with non-obvious, small and blurred-edge
  liver metastases. Our method performs well on the MRI-CRLM dataset and the publicly
  available ISIC-2018 dataset, outperforming state-ofthe-art methods such as CPFNet
  on multiple metrics after boxplot analysis, indicating that it can perform well
  on a wide range of medical image segmentation tasks. Signiﬁcance. The proposed method
  solves the problem mentioned above and improved segmentation accuracy for non-obvious,
  small and blurred-edge targets. Meanwhile, the proposed visualization method Edge-PIM
  can make the edge more prominent, which can assist medical radiologists in their
  research work well.
