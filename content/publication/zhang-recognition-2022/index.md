abstract: Speech is the most natural information carrier for human beings, and it
  is likely to become the main way of human-computer interaction in the future. This
  paper presents an isolated score word recognition method using Mel-scale Frequency
  Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The processing stage
  of the speech signal is the basic stage of the speech recognition system, to analyze
  the speech signal and convert it into speech feature parameters. An endpoints detection
  method is proposed using the joint adjustment of short-term energy and zero-crossing
  rate. It can better detect the endpoints, and directly improve the accuracy of subsequent
  work. On this basis, the MFCC feature is then extracted from the preprocessed speech
  signal, and the DTW pattern matching is applied to the extracted features. In the
  experiments, speeches from multiple speakers were collected, each with a specific
  freestyle kayak action word. The results show that this method has better performance
  comparing with the existing methods.
