abstract: This paper proposes a scheme for localization and restoration of image tampered
  regions using block labelling and adaptive significance. To generate the watermark
  information which includes authentication data and re­ covery data, we propose a
  block coordinate labelling method, which extracts the exact coordinate position
  in­ formation of each block, while the recovery data is composed of Block Adaptive
  Significances (BAS) and bitmaps, which are composed of high and low adaptive significance.
  To detect the tampered area more effectively, we propose a dual detection approach
  that combines the block-based labeling (BBL) and pixel-based labeling (PBL). We
  embed the authentication data into each pixel in the block sequentially and embed
  the position coordinate information of the block into the whole image in ascending
  order. The PBL approach can be used to rapidly complete tamper detection when the
  requirements for PBL are satisfied, whereas the BBL is used to increase the possibility
  of successfully detecting tampering if the conditions are not satisfied. Furthermore,
  we propose a block-level partially symmetric mapping and apply it to self-recovery
  bits in block units, thereby reducing the possibility of recovery bits being lost.
  The experimental results show that in our scheme, the average precision reaches
  86.70%, which is 4% higher than the existing results, and the average F1score reaches
  92.02%, which is 2% higher than the existing results.
