abstract: To precisely diagnose neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease,
  clinicians need to observe the microstructural changes of local brain atrophy with
  the help of structural magnetic resonance image (sMRI). Some Convolutional Neural
  Networks (CNNs) have recently achieved excellent performance in auxiliary clinicians
  to provide the diagnosis suggestion. However, there still exist several challenges.
  Foremost, several researchers manually predefine some regions of interest (ROIs)
  as the input of the CNN-based networks, which impedes the model’s robustness and
  interpretability of clinical applications. Second, since the position relevance
  of pathological features interferes with the surrounding tissue regions in ROIs,
  it is hard for the current CNN-based networks to extract the microstructural changes
  of these ROIs precisely. To address the above challenges, we optimize the Transformer
  structure for Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis and propose an Inheritable Deformable
  Attention Network (IDA-Net). Specifically, the IDA-Net mainly comprises the 3D Deformable
  Self-Attention module and the Inheritable 3D Deformable Self-Attention module. The
  3D Deformable Self-Attention module can automatically adjust the position and scale
  of the selected patches according to the structural changes in sMRI. Furthermore,
  the Inheritable 3D Deformable Self-Attention module can locate and output relatively
  important regions with discriminative features in sMRI, which can assist physicians
  in the clinical diagnosis. Our proposed IDA-Net method is evaluated on the sMRI
  of 2813 subjects from ADNI and AIBL datasets. The results show that our IDA-Net
  method behaves better than several state-of-the-art methods in classification performance
  and model generalization.
