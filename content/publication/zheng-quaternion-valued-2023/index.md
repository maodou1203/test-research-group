abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen classes given only a
  few annotated samples. Encouraging progress has been made for FSS by leveraging
  semantic features learned from base classes with sufﬁcient training samples to represent
  novel classes. The correlation-based methods lack the ability to consider interaction
  of the two subspace matching scores due to the inherent nature of the real-valued
  2D convolutions. In this paper, we introduce a quaternion perspective on correlation
  learning and propose a novel Quaternion-valued Correlation Learning Network (QCLNet),
  with the aim to alleviate the computational burden of high-dimensional correlation
  tensor and explore internal latent interaction between query and support images
  by leveraging operations deﬁned by the established quaternion algebra. Speciﬁcally,
  our QCLNet is formulated as a hyper-complex valued network and represents correlation
  tensors in the quaternion domain, which uses quaternion-valued convolution to explore
  the external relations of query subspace when considering the hidden relationship
  of the support sub-dimension in the quaternion space. Extensive experiments on the
  PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing
  state-of-the-art methods effectively.
